Git Command

1. git init
    Initialized empty Git repository
2. git add <File/Folder>
    The git add command is used to stage changes in your working directory, preparing them to be committed to the Git repository. 
    It moves changes from the working directory to the staging area, where they can later be included in a commit.
3. git commit -m"Message"
    used to save staged changes to the Git repository with a message describing what the commit does.
     The -m option allows you to specify the commit message directly in the command
     making the process faster than opening a text editor for the message.
4. git status
    used in Git to display the current state of the working directory and the staging area.
    It provides details about which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files are untracked.
